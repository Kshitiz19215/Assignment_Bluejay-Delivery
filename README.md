## Overview:
This Python script, timecard_analyzer.py, is designed to analyze timecard data stored in a CSV file and identify certain patterns and anomalies related to employee working hours. The script calculates consecutive working days, checks for short breaks between shifts, and identifies instances where an employee has worked more than the allowed hours in a single shift.

## Usage:
Environment Setup:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x is recommended).
The script uses standard Python libraries, so there's no need for additional installations.
Input Data:

The script expects a CSV file containing timecard data. The default file path is set to 'Assignment_Timecard.csv'. Ensure that your CSV file follows the same format as the provided example.
Run the Script:

Execute the script by running the command: python timecard_analyzer.py.
## Output:

The script generates an output file named 'output.txt' that contains the analysis results.
Script Details:
Datetime Parsing:

The script uses the datetime module to parse date and time information from the input CSV file.
Analysis Parameters:

The script defines certain thresholds and parameters for analysis:
CONSECUTIVE_DAYS_THRESHOLD: Number of consecutive days to check for.
MIN_HOURS_BETWEEN_SHIFTS: Minimum hours allowed between shifts.
MAX_HOURS_IN_SINGLE_SHIFT: Maximum hours allowed in a single shift.
## Output:

The script redirects the standard output to a file ('output.txt') for easier inspection of the analysis results.
Error Handling:

The script includes error handling for datetime parsing to handle cases where the input data is not in the expected format.
Customization:
## File Path:

If your timecard CSV file is located at a different path, modify the file_path variable in the script to point to the correct file.
Adjusting Parameters:

You can modify the analysis parameters (e.g., CONSECUTIVE_DAYS_THRESHOLD, MIN_HOURS_BETWEEN_SHIFTS, MAX_HOURS_IN_SINGLE_SHIFT) based on your specific requirements.
## Note:
Ensure that your CSV file contains columns named 'Employee Name', 'Position ID', 'Time', and 'Time Out' for the script to work correctly.

It is recommended to review the generated 'output.txt' file for detailed insights into employee working patterns and potential issues.

Feel free to contact the script author for any questions or feedback.
